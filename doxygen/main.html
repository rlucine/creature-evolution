 <!-- Compiler and Library Documentation -->
	<h2>Compilers and Libraries</h2>
	<p>
	These programs were written in C, under the standard
	<code>-std=gnu99</code>.
	These projects are intended to compile under MinGW on Windows.
	</p>
 
 <p>
 It is necessary to link with OpenGL, GLEW, and GLUT to compile this
	program; these are not automatically installed or included with the
	program code.
 
 It is also necessary to link with <code>libshared</code>, which is
 my personal standard library. This is included with the project, but
 must be compiled separately by running <code>make all</code> in
 its directory (<code>lib/libshared</code>).

 <!-- Evolution Program -->
 <hr>
 <h1><a id="evolution">Evolution Program</a></h2>
 <p>
 The main <code>evolution.exe</code> program is capable of generating mass-spring
 creatures that move forward along the X-axis to varying degrees of efficiency.
 To generate a new creature, run <code>evolution forward</code>. This will test
 creatures for 100 generations, where the population size of creatures is 1000
 individuals. After completion, the best creature is saved in a file and the
 creature is animated. The program can also be used as
 <code>evolution play filename.creature</code>, which will simply animate the
 creature saved in <code>filename.creature</code>.
 
 <h2>Provided Files</h3>
 The <code>data</code> folder contains several creature files. It's unclear if these
 will be useful on other systems because no platform-independent struct padding
 system was assumed; hence, the file struct may appear different on other computers.
 If these do not work, videos are provided, and new creatures may be created and saved
 from that system.
 
 <h3>Goals</h3>
 The goal of this project was to create a highly efficient genetic algorithm and
 a reasonably efficient creature model, such that creatures could be generated very
 quickly. I also hoped to discover interesting emergent behavior. Both of these
 goals were met.
 </p>
 
 <hr>
 <h2>Creature Model</h2>
 <p>
 Creatures are a collection of nodes and muscles. Each creature has from 4 to 16
 nodes, which are chosen at random within the unit hemisphere. These nodes are then
 connected at random by up to 64 muscles. The muscles of a creature must span all
 of the creature's nodes.
 </p>
 
 <h3>Nodes</h3>
 <p>
 Each of the nodes in a creature has an initial position and a coefficient of friction.
 The initial position can influence how well the creature can start moving forward
 (such as a sprinter's stance). The coefficient of friction represents how well the
 creature can use the node to move, when that node is in contact with the ground.
 A creature is rendered as a series of white and blue lines, where blue coloration is
 added only if a node is touching the ground. Bluer nodes have higher friction.
 The creature's shadow is also projected onto the XZ plane for clarity.
 </p>
 
 <h3>Muscles</h3>
 <p>
 The muscles of a creature each have extended and contracted lengths. All muscles
 begin in the extended state (which is relaxed). A muscle also has a strength
 parameter, which is similar to the spring constant in a mass-spring model. If
 the length of the muscle is different from its target length, spring force is
 exerted on the nodes the muscle connects. Muscles cannot connect the same node
 to itself, but there can be multiple muscles connecting the same pair of nodes,
 which can lead to emergent behavior later on (such as a link that has more than
 2 phases).
 </p>
 
 <h3>Environment</h3>
 <p>
 Creatures exist in a 3D space, where the XZ plane represents the ground, and the
 Y axis represents height into the air. Creatures are currently being optimized
 to run down the X axis with as little divergence in Z or Y as possible. The
 general area of the X axis is rendered as a set of goal lines, where a large green
 line occurs every 10 units and a small grey line occurs every unit.
 </p>
 
 <h3>Energy</h3>
 <p>
 The animation driver keeps track of a creature's energy expenditure. Energy is
 used when a creature contracts its muscles, but expanding a muscle is free.
 This is useful to keep track of how wildly the creature is behaving. A creature
 dies if it uses energy beyond some programmer-defined threshold (currently 2048).
 A dead creature is unable to contract any of its muscles, and just sinks to the
 ground. Dead creatures are rendered in red and pink hues.
 </p>
 
 <hr>
 <h2>Control Model</h2>
 <p>
 A creature is animated by repeatedly playing a cyclic action sequence. An action
 sequence consists of a set of 64 actions, which is stored as a part of the
 creature's data. Values in the action sequence are either empty or specify the
 index of a muscle that should change its state between expanded and contracted.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 All 64 actions in the sequence occur over the course of 1 second of simulation
 time, and are evenly distributed across this time period. The animation driver
 handles all cases where the time step does not match the action sequence timing
 (for example, if a time step covers several actions, or if multiple time steps
 are needed to animate the same action). When a muscle action occurs, the muscle
 specified changes its phase between contracting and expanding. The timing of these
 contract and expand actions drives the creature's motion.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Because the action sequence is repeated, a muscle specified in the sequence will
 usually be contracted on odd cycles and expanded on even cycles, provding a 1-second
 period of motion for that muscle. Because this is somewhat restricted, multiple
 actions per muscle are allowed to be in the sequence, which can decrease the
 muscle's oscillation period. Empty actions are also allowed, where the creature doesn't
 change any of its muscles and simply proceeds as it was before, using the extra
 action time. Both of these action types are allowed because the motion that
 drives a creature is wholly unpredictable to a human, but from the perspective of an
 optimizer having all of these free variables could prove useful.
 </p>
 
 <hr>
 <h2>Animation</h2>
 <p>
 Creatures are animated by playing the action sequence repeatedly. A Midpoint
 integration scheme is used, with a fixed time step of 0.005 seconds (which was
 deemed the most stable). On each time step, forces are computed at each of a
 creature's nodes: there are spring forces from all the muscles the node is attached
 to, as well as damping force along those springs to prevent explosions. Each node
 also experiences a drag force from the air. Nodes touching the XZ plane experience
 fricitonal force based on the predefined node properties discussed earlier. Finally,
 gravitational force is implemented.
 </p>
 
 <hr>
 <h2>Optimization</h2>
 <p>
 Creatures are optimized using a genetic algorithm. First, a population of 1000 random
 valid creatures is built. A creature's fitness is measured by playing the first ten
 seconds of its animation and computing the average X-velocity of the center of mass,
 while penalizing divergence in the Y or Z directions. The most fit half of the creatures
 survive, while the other half die and are replaced by new creatures. The population always
 remains at a fixed size, which was useful for efficiency and to prevent exponential space blowup.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 New creatures are generated by sexual reproduction. The properties of two parent creatures
 are interleaved to create offspring by selecting nodes and muscles from either parent at
 random. To do this, I made sure that if a creature has <i>n</i>
 nodes, the muscle at index <i>m</i> less than <i>n</i> always joins node <i>m</i>
 and another node with index less than <i>m</i>. This guarantees by induction that when a
 creature gets recombined, selecting muscles at random from either parent is sufficient to
 guarantee the muscles of the offspring span all the nodes. Finally, the
 action sequences of either parent are broken in half at a random index and glued back together
 to form the child's actions.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Various efficiency measures were taken to speed up the optimization. First, the
 <code>CREATURE</code> data structure is fixed size and contains no pointers. Because the
 number of nodes, muscles, and actions are upper bounded, arrays can be constructed with
 constant size to hold those properties. As a result, the creature data never needs to
 allocate something on the heap, which provided extra bonuses as creature data can directly
 be written and recovered from a file with no encoding whatsoever, provided the system
 has the same integer size (32-bit versus 64-bit).
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The algorithm itself is also highly optimized. Because the population size is fixed,
 the algorithm simply allocates enough space to hold all 1000 individuals as well as
 500 potential offspring. A heap is also allocated so that creatures can be sorted by
 fitness in O(nlgn) time. All allocation takes place in advance of running the algorithm,
 so allocation time is not a factor in the generation time. This also has the advantage of
 being very cache-friendly, as essentially all the data is local within these three
 structures.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Finally, "bag" data structures
 (essentially unordered lists) are used to allow addition and deletion from the arrays
 in O(1) time. Addition is accomplished with a tail index, and deletion is accomplished
 by swapping the last item into the index to be deleted, and decreasing the tail index.
 Overall, the per-generation runtime is O(nlgn) as opposed to an O(n<sup>2</sup>lgn)
 if ordinary lists or naive O(n<sup>2</sup>) sorting were used. This is provably the
 minimal asymptotic runtime, as sorting is Omega(nlgn).
 </p>
 
 <hr>
 <h2>Results</h2>
 <p>
 The algorithm itself was capable of evaluating 1,000 creatures, each for 10 seconds
 of simulation time, in about 6 seconds of real time. The program can run at 1500 times
 the speed of real time. Due to the expensive fitness function, the fitness was memoized
 for creatures that survived more than 1 generation, and so the algorithm could
 achieve as much as 7,000 times the speed of real time in later generations. Overall,
 running 100 generations usually costs about 2 to 6 minutes.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Some creatures were evolved and included in the data folder. Most of the creatures tend
 to tumble inelegantly, which is caused by imperfect optimization. In general, these
 creatures tend to move forward along the track although some diverge slightly.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 An interesting inconsistency was observed when playing back animations. Because the
 program cannot accurately measure its runtime (precision is only 1/1000 of a second),
 small variations in the set of time steps can extrapolate to very different motion
 due to accumulated integration error. As a result, playback of creature animation
 is not perfect and often not reproducible exactly, although general trends of motion
 remain. This could be fixed with a smaller time step, although this would cause
 the optimizer to increase its runtime by a similar factor, leading to impossibly
 large wait time.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Some creatures also learn to explode. This is also a factor of the time step being
 too large, but again increasing the step leads the simulation to take way too long
 despite my optimizations.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The overall results are interesting. The <code>normal.creature</code> is a basic
 randomly generated creature that moves essentially nowhere, for scale. The
 <code>flailing.creature</code> moves forward wildly and tends to fall flat on
 the ground, rendering it unable to exert any torque to get back up, and so it
 ends up getting stuck. The <code>launcher.creature</code> was the most surprising,
 as it learned to shoot itself forward through the air to avoid acidentally turning
 around. The remaining creatures are more of the same techniques.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The video below shows five interesting creatures, the first being the normal
 creature and the last being the launcher creature.

 <h2>Further Work</h2>
 <p>
 It is still unclear how well-tuned the physical simulation is, as increased amounts
 of friction, air drag, or damping force might prove useful. Because there are so many
 free variables, reconfiguring the simulation must be done manually, so the first
 improvement would be to create a GUI for tuning parameters. The next obvious
 extension is to task creatures with doing things other than moving right: perhaps
 more robust, interesting fitness functions could be created to rule out inelegant
 solutions like launching and tumbling.
